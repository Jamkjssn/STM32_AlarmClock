# STM32_AlarmClock
This is the final version of my final project for ECEN260. It is an Alarm Clock utilizing UART communication with a computer, I2C communication with a disply, interrupts going to a light, and the RTC clock in the STM32IDE

Below is the full Class Report on the project, it goes further into detail regarding specification, schematic, testing, and known limitations.
